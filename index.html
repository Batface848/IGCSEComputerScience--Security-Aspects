                <h3>Malware</h3>
                    <a href="#"><img class="image" align="center" src="images/malware code example.png"></a>
                <p>
                    
                    A malware is a software program that is designed to damage or disrupt a computer. There are many types of malware and they may be encountered <br> when using the internet. However, the only ones you have to learn are: <br>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Viruses</li>
                        <li>Spyware</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The others are:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Ransomware - Blackmailing</li>
                        <li>Adware - Spams ads</li>
                        <li>Worms - Spread across computers</li>
                        <li>Trojans - Sneak malware into computers</li>
                        <li>Botnets - Turn PCs into zombies</li>
                    
                    <br>

                    <strong>Virus</strong>

                    <br><br>
                    
                    Viruses are programs that are downloaded into a PC without the user's knowledge or permission, designed specifically to harm the computer <br> and corrupt the files on it. <br>

                    The most common virus replicates itself over and over again until this brings the computer system to a halt. <br>

                    Viruses are usually spread via sharing files and attachments, especially through emails. <br><br>

                        <a href="#"><img class="image" align="center" src="images/virus attack.jpeg"></a>

                    <br><br>

                    <em>Examples:</em>

                    <br><br>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Creeper Virus - A test that did not intend to harm the computer but flood the message "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"</li>
                        <li>WannaCry - A ransomware attack in 2017 that infected 200,000 computers in 150 countries using the EternalBlue cyberattack.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <br>And their counters are:
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Reaper - Once it is ran, the Creeper virus gets deleted and the computer is not harmed in any way.</li>
                        <li>WannaCry Killswitch - A killswitch that is discovered by researcher Marcus Hutchins which prevents the malware by registering a <br> domain name.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <br>

                    <strong>Spyware</strong>

                    <br><br>

                    Spywares are softwares that are created to collect information on a user's computer through its internet connection. Just like viruses, <br> this is done without the user's knowledge or permission. This data is then usually sold unlawfully for marketing purposes. <br> 
                    
                    Information that can be collected are:

                    <br><br>

                    <ol>

                        <li>Passwords</li>
                        <li>Bank Details</li>
                        <li>Credit Card Details</li>
                        <li>Identification Details</li>

                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    
                    It is often downloaded from untrustworthy websites and hides inside the data downloaded, infecting it in the process. <br>

                    This means it may also reduce bandwidth availbaility in internet connections.

                <h3>Hacking and DDoS</h3>

                <p>

                    Hacking is the process where unauthorised and/or unlawful access to a network or computer is gained by a person, known as a hacker. This is us- <br> ually done by searching for a weakness in the computer system and then use this to enter it. They can be done for many reasons. <br>

                    There are two types of hackers. These are:

                    <ul>

                        <li>White Hat Hackers - They expose security issues in a network or system not for unlawful reasons. They can be hired by organisations.</li>
                        <li>Black Hat Hackers - They do the same thing but for unlawful reasons. These, if caught, will be set a charge.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <a href="#"><img class="image" src="images/white and black hat hackers.jpg"></a>

                    <p> The Distributed Denial of Service is a type of network attack that floods a server with requests and disrupts its service eventually from the volume of traffic. <br>
                    
                    <br>

                    <br><br>

                    There are many who had been attacked by the Service. Below is a bar chart of the number of attacks in the recent years:

                <h3>Protection Against These Risks</h3>

                <p>

                    To protect against malware, hacking, DDoS and other cyberattacks, you can use the following protection methods:

                    <ul>

                        <li>Anti-Virus Softwares</li>
                        <li>Firewalls</li>
                        <li>Keeping an eye out about phishing and social engineering</li>

                    </ul>

                    <a href="#"><img class="image" src="images/antivirus_software.jpg"></a>

                    <p>Anti-virus softwares, as the name suggests, are softwares used to prevent, scan, detect and delete viruses which runs automatically so as to provide real-time protection against these virus attacks once installed. They cannot prevent the entry of an attack but they can detect and <br> remove it. <br>

                    Firewalls are hardware or software systems that protects unauthorised access to a computer or network by blocking their transmissions. These include:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ol>

                        <li>Packet filters - A filter that checks the source and destination IP addresses to determine whether to allow or disallow packets by applying <br> its rules there. </li>
                        <li>Stateful inspection - Collects data from every connection made to a network, checks its qualities to see whether the connection is safe, keeps a list of the safe connections and inspect them to see if there is malicious code inside.</li>
                        <li>Proxy server firewalls - A gate between the user and the internet and ke- <br> eps the user safe by filtering out unsafe content, therefore maintaining privacy due to its different IP address.</li>

                    </ol>

                    <a href="#"><img class="image" src="images/proxy server firewall.jpg"></a>

                    <p>Phishing is a type of email that is sent to induce users to revealing their private information. The most common ones, called deceptive phishing, use threats and a sense of urgency in the emails to scare the users into doing what the attackers want. <br><br>

                    <a href="#"><img class="image" src="images/Phishing.jpg"></a>

                    <br><br>

                    Social engineering is a psychological manipulation method to make people exploiting information so as to find a way to hack into your software. <br> The most common ones use the phishing technique mentioned above.
